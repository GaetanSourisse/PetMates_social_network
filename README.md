"PetMates" un projet Ada Tech School de réseau social (PHP, mySql, CSS, HTML)

Here is result of collectiv school project I did with two other teammates in february 2023. 👩‍🎓 The idea of this project was to practice PHP and have some understanding of what a complete project could look like in PHP. We had seven days to build it so the main focus was on features and not design. It definitely could use some good refactoring too ! 🫣
To talk some more about the main idea of PetMates, goal was to provide space for petlovers to exchange about their animals. 🐶 Users can share advice, they can ask for meet-ups or anything else related to domestics animals. They can post message or comments, and tags their posts with name subjects for easier sorting. We add possibility of liking posts 💫, following friends and add pets to your profile.
